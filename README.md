# Entity Component System (Archetype based)
## Overview
This is an entity component system based on archetype architecture in modern
C++. There are 3 fundamental parts of the system:

> Components: Data that exists for one concern.

> Entity: An Id that represents an entity in the Internal code structure

> System: Logic that operates over the components for some repetitive action

Entity component systems solve the problem of wide and deep inheritance that
exists mainly in game and UI programming.
